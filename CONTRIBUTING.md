# Contributing to RCMS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/Akshay-Verma-CS/RCMS/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write Good Code

We appreciate good and clean code. Here are some rules to stick by:

- **Write Generic Code**: Make packages or functions as generic as possible, but not any more generic than needed.
- **Limit Dependencies**: Try not to introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. If you do, explain why in the pull request.
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for functions and variables.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Akshay-Verma-CS/RCMS/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](LINK-TO-NEW-ISSUE); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can use any editor you like, but ensure your code format adheres to our style.
* Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for style guidance.

## Open To Suggested Improvements

We are open to any suggested improvements. Feel free to discuss any changes you wish to make in the issues or pull requests.

## License
